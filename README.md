#### Description:

This is the third educational project at Hexlet.

It's called the **RSS aggregator**.

RSS is a specialized format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements, and other materials.

This service is able to poll the RSS feeds of websites for new posts and shows them in a convenient way, noting what has been read. It also allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them yourself and adds new entries to the general stream.
